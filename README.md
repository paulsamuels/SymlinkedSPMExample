# Sample project

This is a sample project to accompany [this](https://paul-samuels.com/blog/2018/09/01/creating-spm-tools-from-your-existing-codebase/) blog post.

The task being demonstrated is creating a Swift Package Manager project to reuse code from an iOS project. The iOS project is intentionally basic and should not be used as an example of how to write iOS code.
